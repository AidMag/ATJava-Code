/*
Write a program that prompts the user for a phrase and then counts the number of times the letter 'e' is used in the phrase:
Use the Scanner class to scan in the phrase as a String
Write a for loop that loops through the elements of the string
Loop from zero up to by not including the length of the string
Use the charAt() function to compare the letter at that position to the letter 'e'
Keep track of how many letters are 'e'
Print the number of times the letter 'e' occurred after you have looped through the String
