/*
Write a program that generates 10 random integers:
Use a loop to iterate through the numbers
Each random integer should range from 1 to 10;
Calculate the average of the 10 numbers.
Change the number of times you loop to 1000 and calculate the average value.
Does the average value make sense? Explain.

Hints for Solving Part C:
The static function Math.random() gives a number from 0.0 up to but not including 1.0
Can you change this to give a number from 0.0 up to but not including 10.0?
Can you change it further to instead give an integer from 0 to 9?
Can you shift this so the number ranges from 1 to 10 instead of 0 to 9?
