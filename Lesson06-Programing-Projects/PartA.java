/*
Write a program that reads a temperature value and the letter C for Celsius or F for Fahrenheit.
Print whether water is liquid, solid, or gaseous at the given temperature at sea level.
Use a freezing point of 0 deg C and a boiling point of 100 deg C for this example.
Your program run should look something like the following,
Enter a temperature and a 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit: 212 F
At a temperature of 212.00 F, water is in a gaseous state (i.e., steam).
