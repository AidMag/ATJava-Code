Part B:
What is the output of the following code and why?

    public static int getInt() {
        try {
            return 1;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return 2;
        } finally {
            return 3;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(getInt());
    }


The output would be 3 becuase finally in a try catch statment always return/runs. 
It would not return 1 becuase it can only return one integer and since finally always runs the method will return 1.
