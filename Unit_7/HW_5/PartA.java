/*
Write a public static method that asks the user to enter quiz scores ranging from 0 to 100
Scan in the quiz score as an integer value.  
Pass an input Scanner as an argument to your method
If the user does not provide a value in the allowed range, throw an NumberFormatException.
If the function is unable to parse the user's input value, also throw a NumberFormatException
Write a sample program that demonstrates how your method works and that uses a try-catch statement to check whether or not a valid quiz score was obtained.
