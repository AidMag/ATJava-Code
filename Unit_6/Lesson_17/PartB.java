/*
Write a Java program that in the main program declares and initializes the following two arrays,

8 6 7
5 3 0



0 7 6 5
2 2 0 1
8 4 5 7


Add a public static method to your Java program that takes a 2D array as an argument and prints the elements in the array in row by column format.

public static void print(int[][] values)

Use the method in your program to print the two arrays that you declared and initialized.

The output of your program run for Part B should look something like the following,

First array:
  8,  6,  7 
  5,  3,  0

Second array:
  0,  7,  6,  5
  2,  2,  0,  1
  8,  4,  5,  7

Remember, you should use a method to traverse and print the 2D arrays.  
If you do not use a method to do the printing, you will lose points for the grading of this assignment.
*/

public class PartB {
    
}
