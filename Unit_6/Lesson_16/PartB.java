/*
Write a program that has a method that takes a variable number of double values as its argument.  
The method then calculates and returns the average of these parameters as a double value.

public static double average(double ... values)

Test your method for the following cases,
average(10, 8, 9)
average(scores)  where scores is an array of doubles equal to {100, 90, 80, 100, 80}

Important Note: 
If you use a partially filled array to store your values, then when you calculate the average using your method, 
    you should pass a copy of your original array that only contains the valid test scores.  
You can use the Arrays.copyOf() static method to make a new copy of the original array that is only equal in 
    length to the current size of your partially filled array.
